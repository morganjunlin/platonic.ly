    "description": "Our mobile application allows clients to sort through user-submitted events happening in their area. Events are time boxed between an hour and a few days. Users can request to join an event and the host can decide whether to accept them or not based on the userâ€™s profile and potential for a quality friendly connection. Our app is for everyone to use, with some of our primary target audience being new transplants, since they may find it challenging to meet friends in a new city."
